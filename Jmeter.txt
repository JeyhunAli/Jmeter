this is the new file its all about jmeter
jmeter is open source its available in zip and binary file just need to download it 
it performance testing tool 

in mac when u want to start jmeter
go to the cmd line --->> go to the jmeter bin directory
---->>> then
 sh jmeter.sh run this command 
then you will see UI of the jmeter




<<<<< Connection Time----->> time to connect to servver from client

Jmeter 
Connection is happening with the help of TCP id protocol 
Transfer connection protocol 
Once we send the request within some millisecond its happening and its call 
Connection time 

Response time how fast or late we get respond from the server 

Throughput this means 
Per second or per hour sending number of the request 

Scenario is basically like a scenario 
Its like a use cases business flow 
Fir example lets say in Uber application there sales day 
And they sending email to people that you discount days on ordering Uber 
What people do just go application set the destination order Uber and go 
This scenario and business flow 

Bottleneck this means in the written code maybe some poor design code 
Or something else the response is not happening or its stuck on the server and it's degrading the response of the server 

Capacity is basically capacity of something of application of the server 
And number of the data processing until the performance of application is degraded 

Concurrency this means lets say 
Number of user in the same time buying movie tickets for the same slot and same movie 
Basically simultaneously or virtually number of users exactly for the same point 

Key performance indicators 
KPI this basically means 
The main target of the application performance especially in the production level
